# Iris says!  

### A minimalist platform for learning, understanding and realising Iris Flower Classification.
This is an educational tool to encourage learning Iris Flower Classification with inbuilt graphical visualisations and on-spot prediction system. We have loaded the platform with 7 highly optimized, pretrained models of different for faster prediction namely,  
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- K-Neighbors Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## Major Reach
This platform is majorily developed for beginners in Data Analytics/Machine Learning. Giving a strong foundation in these topics enhances them to move forward faster in this ever-growing field. They will understand how to approach any data and analyze them and then use it to build powerful machine learning models.  
The platform can play a major part in showcasing machine learning for student in high schools and other bootcamps.  

## Higher Optimizations
- The tool can grow in size to explore various other famous datasets and the usage of machine learning in each of them and not only iris.  
- The tool can become a platform for users to develop their own models on that dataset and upload them. They can also write content about the database.
- The Graphical visualisations can be enhanced using various tools of javascript.

## Tools used to develop the project
- Flask (Python)
- Scikit-Learn (Python)
- Plotly-Express (Python)
- Basic webtools(HTML, CSS, JS(some Jquery too!))
